We show that OFB and CTR are secure assuming that the underlying block cipher is a standard secure PRF (a pseudorandom function secure under classical queries). We give counterexamples that show that CBC, CFB, and XTS are not secure under the same assumption. And we give proofs that CBC and CFB mode are secure if we assume a quantum secure PRF (secure under queries in superposition).},

	abstract = {In recent years, there has been a substantial amount of research on quantum computers –machines that exploit quantum mechanical phenomena to solve mathematical problems that are difficult or intractable for conventional computers. If large-scale quantum computers are ever built, they will be able to break many of the public-key cryptosystems currently in use. This would seriously compromise the confidentiality and integrity of digital communications on the Internet and elsewhere. The goal of post-quantum cryptography (also called quantum-resistant cryptography) is to develop cryptographic systems that are secure against both quantum and classical computers, and can interoperate with existing communications protocols and networks. This Internal Report shares the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)’s current understanding about the status of quantum computing and post-quantum cryptography, and outlines NIST’s initial plan to move forward in this space. The report also recognizes the challenge of moving to new cryptographic infrastructures and therefore emphasizes the need for agencies to focus on crypto agility.},

	abstract = {Smart grid depends on an advanced communication network to collect information from the power grid, and to disseminate control commands to the control devices. To safeguard the power grid, it is crucial to ensure information confidentiality in the communication networks. Quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols help in generating, and distributing secret keys between communication parties, and such secret keys are required in symmetric cryptography. The combination of QKD protocols, and symmetric cryptography are known to be unconditionally secure, which means information confidentiality can be guaranteed even against an eavesdropper, who has unlimited resources. This article provides a concise review of existing works on QKD protocols, and their applications in smart grid communications. Deploying QKD protocols in smart grid is challenging because distance between the control center, and control devices can be larger than the limits of existing protocols. Also, QKD protocols require an expensive quantum channel between each pair of sender, and receiver nodes, and there is large number of control devices with diverse capabilities in smart grid. We have classified existing works based on the challenges they have dealt with. Compared to the rich literature on QKD protocols in general, there are significantly fewer works in the specific context of smart grid. This can be an indication for opportunity to make a significant contribution. We have also identified a few research challenges that can be potential future works.},

However, with the Scarani-Acin-Ribordy-Gisin 2004 (SARG04) QKD protocol, the unconditionally secure key can be extracted from the two-photon component by modifying the classical post-processing procedure in the BB84 protocol. Employing the merits of SARG04 QKD protocol and six-state preparation, one can extract secure key from the components of single photon up to four photons. In this paper, we provide the exact relations between the secure key rate and the bit error rate in a six-state SARG04 protocol with single-photon, two-photon, three-photon and four-photon sources. By restricting the mutual information between the phase error and bit error, we obtain a higher secure bit error rate threshold of the multiphoton components than previous works. Besides, we compare the performances of the six-state SARG04 with other prepare-and-measure QKD protocols using decoy states.},

	abstract = {In crittografia la sigla RSA indica un algoritmo di crittografia asimmetrica, inventato nel 1977 da Ronald Rivest, Adi Shamir  e Leonard Adleman utilizzabile per cifrare o firmare informazioni.
Nel 1976 Whitfield Diffie e Martin Hellman, crittologi americani, furono i primi a pubblicare un sistema che si basasse sulla creazione di un cifrario "asimmetrico" composto da "chiavi pubbliche"; anche se pochi anni prima ci avevano già pensato James H. Ellis, Clifford Cocks, e Malcolm J. Williamson dei servizi segreti inglesi, la notizia era coperta dal segreto militare e fu rivelata soltanto nel 1997.Il sistema di crittografia si basa sull'esistenza di due chiavi distinte, che vengono usate per cifrare e decifrare. Se la prima chiave viene usata per la cifratura, la seconda deve necessariamente essere utilizzata per la decifratura e viceversa. La questione fondamentale è che, nonostante le due chiavi siano fra loro dipendenti, non è possibile risalire dall'una all'altra, in modo che se anche si è a conoscenza di una delle due chiavi, non si possa risalire all'altra, garantendo in questo modo l'integrità della crittografia.
Per ottenere una discreta sicurezza è necessario utilizzare chiavi binarie di almeno 2048 bit. Quelle a 512 bit sono ricavabili in poche ore. Le chiavi a 1024 bit, ancora oggi ampiamente utilizzate, non sono più consigliabili.
La fattorizzazione di interi grandi, infatti, è progredita rapidamente mediante l'utilizzo di hardware sofisticati, al punto che potrebbe essere possibile fattorizzare un intero di 1024 bit in un solo anno di tempo, al costo di un milione di dollari (un costo sostenibile per qualunque grande organizzazione, agenzia o intelligence).},

Extensive studies have been undertaken on QKD since it was noted that quantum computers could break public key cryptosystems based on number theory. Actually, the progress of research in this field allows the implementation of QKD outside of laboratories. Efforts are made to exploit this technology in the existing communication networks and to improve the performance and reliability of the implemented technologies. Some research is in progress for the integration of QKD with the protocols in different layers of OSI model. The examples of such research effort are the integration of QKD in point-to-point protocol (PPP) OSI layer 2 and the integration of QKD with IPSEC at OSI layer-3. All these works are moving towards the utilization of QKD technology for enhancing the security of modern computing applications on the internet. In this paper, we present a novel extension of the TLS protocol based on QKD. We introduce a scheme for integrating Quantum Cryptography in this protocol. Our approach improves the security of the process of authentication and data encryption. Also, we describe an example to illustrate the feasibility of our scheme’s implementation.},

	url = {https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=One-time_pad&oldid=1110582075},
	abstract = {In cryptography, the one-time pad (OTP) is an encryption technique that cannot be cracked, but requires the use of a single-use pre-shared key that is not smaller than the message being sent. In this technique, a plaintext is paired with a random secret key (also referred to as a one-time pad). Then, each bit or character of the plaintext is encrypted by combining it with the corresponding bit or character from the pad using modular addition.
The resulting ciphertext will be impossible to decrypt or break if the following four conditions are met:
The key must be at least as long as the plaintext.
The key must be random (uniformly distributed in the set of all possible keys and independent of the plaintext), entirely sampled from a non-algorithmic, chaotic source such as a hardware random number generator. It is not sufficient for OTP keys to pass statistical randomness tests as such tests cannot measure entropy, and the number of bits of entropy must be at least equal to the number of bits in the plaintext. For example, using cryptographic hashes or mathematical functions (such as logarithm or square root) to generate keys from fewer bits of entropy would break the uniform distribution requirement, and therefore would not provide perfect secrecy.
The key must never be reused in whole or in part.
The key must be kept completely secret by the communicating parties.It has also been mathematically proven that any cipher with the property of perfect secrecy must use keys with effectively the same requirements as OTP keys. Digital versions of one-time pad ciphers have been used by nations for critical diplomatic and military communication, but the problems of secure key distribution make them impractical for most applications.
First described by Frank Miller in 1882, the one-time pad was re-invented in 1917. On July 22, 1919, U.S. Patent 1,310,719 was issued to Gilbert Vernam for the XOR operation used for the encryption of a one-time pad. Derived from his Vernam cipher, the system was a cipher that combined a message with a key read from a punched tape. In its original form, Vernam's system was vulnerable because the key tape was a loop, which was reused whenever the loop made a full cycle. One-time use came later, when Joseph Mauborgne recognized that if the key tape were totally random, then cryptanalysis would be impossible.The "pad" part of the name comes from early implementations where the key material was distributed as a pad of paper, allowing the current top sheet to be torn off and destroyed after use. For concealment the pad was sometimes so small that a powerful magnifying glass was required to use it. The KGB used pads of such size that they could fit in the palm of a hand, or in a walnut shell. To increase security, one-time pads were sometimes printed onto sheets of highly flammable nitrocellulose, so that they could easily be burned after use.
There is some ambiguity to the term "Vernam cipher" because some sources use "Vernam cipher" and "one-time pad" synonymously, while others refer to any additive stream cipher as a "Vernam cipher", including those based on a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG).},

	abstract = {A Bell test, also known as Bell inequality test or Bell experiment, is a real-world physics experiment designed to test the theory of quantum mechanics in relation to Albert Einstein's concept of local realism. Named for John Stewart Bell, the experiments test whether or not the real world satisfies local realism, which requires the presence of some additional local variables (called "hidden" because they are not a feature of quantum theory) to explain the behavior of particles like photons and electrons. To date, all Bell tests have found that the hypothesis of local hidden variables is inconsistent with the way that physical systems behave. According to Bell's theorem, if nature actually operates in accord with any theory of local hidden variables, then the results of a Bell test will be constrained in a particular, quantifiable way. If a Bell experiment is performed and the results are not thus constrained, then the hypothesized local hidden variables cannot exist. Such results would support the position that there is no way to explain the phenomena of quantum mechanics in terms of a more fundamental description of nature that is more in line with the rules of classical physics.
Many types of Bell tests have been performed in physics laboratories, often with the goal of ameliorating problems of experimental design or set-up that could in principle affect the validity of the findings of earlier Bell tests. This is known as "closing loopholes in Bell tests".Bell inequality violations are also used in some quantum cryptography protocols, whereby a spy's presence is detected when Bell's inequalities cease to be violated.},

When m=4, the physical part of the protocol is identical to most experimental implementations of BB84 and SARG04 protocols and they differ only in classical communications and data processing. We compute their total keyrate as function of the channel transmission T, using general information theoretical arguments and we show that they have a higher keyrate than the more standard protocols, both for fixed and optimized average photon number of the WCPs. When no decoy-state protocols (DSPs) are applied, the scaling of the keyrate with transmission is improved from T2 for BB84 to T{\textasciicircum}(1+1/(m-2)). If a DSP is applied, we show how the keyrates scale linearly with T, with an improvement of the prefactor by 75.96 \% for m=4. High values of \$ m \$ allow to asymptotically approach the keyrate obtained with ideal single photon pulses. The fact that the keyrates of these sifting-less protocols are higher compared to those of the aforementioned more standard protocols show that the latter are not optimal, since they do not extract all the available secret key from the experimental correlations.},

	abstract = {Quantum computing challenges the computational hardness assumptions anchoring the security of public-key ciphers, such as the prime factorization and the discrete logarithm problem. To prepare for the quantum era and withstand the attacks equipped with quantum computing, the security and cryptography communities are designing new quantum-resistant public-key ciphers. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is collecting and standardizing the postquantum ciphers, similarly to its past involvements in establishing DES and AES as symmetric cipher standards. The NIST ﬁnalist algorithms for public-key signatures are Dilithium, Falcon, and Rainbow. Finding common ground to compare these algorithms can be diﬃcult because of their design, the underlying computational hardness assumptions (lattice based vs. multivariate based), and the diﬀerent metrics used for security strength analyses in the previous research (qubits vs. quantum gates). We overcome such challenges and compare the security and the performances of the ﬁnalist post-quantum ciphers of Dilithium, Falcon, and Rainbow. For security comparison analyses, we advance the prior literature by using the depth-width cost for quantum circuits (DW cost) to measure the security strengths and by analyzing the security in Universal Quantum Gate Model and with Quantum Annealing. For performance analyses, we compare the algorithms’ computational loads in the execution time as well as the communication costs and implementation overheads when integrated with Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)/Internet Protocol (IP). Our work presents a security comparison and performance analysis as well as the trade-oﬀ analysis to inform the post-quantum cipher design and standardization to protect computing and networking in the post-quantum era.},

	abstract = {If quantum computers were built, they would pose concerns for public key cryptography as we know it. Among other cryptographic techniques, they would jeopardize the use of PKI X.509 certificates (RSA, ECDSA) used today for authentication. To overcome the concern, new quantum secure signature schemes have been proposed in the literature. Most of these schemes have significantly larger public key and signature sizes than the ones used today. Even though post-quantum signatures could work well for some usecases like software signing, there are concerns about the effect their size and processing cost would have on technologies using X.509 certificates. In this work, we investigate the viability of post-quantum signatures in X.509 certificates and protocols that use them (e.g. TLS, IKEv2). We prove that, in spite of common concerns, they could work in today's protocols and could be a viable solution to the emergence of quantum computing. We also quantify the overhead they introduce in protocol connection establishment and show that even though it is significant, it is not detrimental. Finally, we formalize the areas of further testing necessary to conclusively establish that the signature schemes standardized in NIST's PQ Project can work with X.509 certs in a post-quantum Internet.},

Moreover, the predictions by these theories must significantly differ from those by quantum mechanics. Experimental results evidently refute the theorem’s predictions for these theories and favour those of quantum mechanics. The conclusions are philosophically startling: either one must totally abandon the realistic philosophy of most working scientists, or dramatically revise our concept of space-time.},

	abstract = {Quantum physics can be exploited to generate true random numbers, which have important roles in many applications, especially in cryptography. Genuine randomness from the measurement of a quantum system reveals the inherent nature of quantumness—coherence, an important feature that differentiates quantum mechanics from classical physics. The generation of genuine randomness is generally considered impossible with only classical means. On the basis of the degree of trustworthiness on devices, quantum random number generators (QRNGs) can be grouped into three categories. The first category, practical QRNG, is built on fully trusted and calibrated devices and typically can generate randomness at a high speed by properly modelling the devices. The second category is self-testing QRNG, in which verifiable randomness can be generated without trusting the actual implementation. The third category, semi-self-testing QRNG, is an intermediate category that provides a tradeoff between the trustworthiness on the device and the random number generation speed.},

Instead, random cryptographic bits are kept safe within the unique mesoscopic randomness of two volumetric scattering materials. We demonstrate how a shared set of patterned optical probes can generate 10 gigabits of statistically verified randomness between a pair of unique 2 mm3 scattering objects. This shared randomness is used to facilitate information-theoretically secure communication following a modified one-time pad protocol. Benefits of volumetric physical storage over electronic memory include the inability to probe, duplicate or selectively reset any bits without fundamentally altering the entire key space. Our ability to securely couple the randomness contained within two unique physical objects can extend to strengthen hardware required by a variety of cryptographic protocols, which is currently a critically weak link in the security pipeline of our increasingly mobile communication culture.},
